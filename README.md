# @metreeca/core

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@metreeca/core)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metreeca/core)

A lightweight library of core TypeScript utilities.

**@metreeca/core** is a zero-dependency foundation for type-safe operations, data validation, and functional
programming, providing utilities for type guards, safe casts, comparisons, immutability, data manipulation, and error
handling.

# Installation

```shell
npm install @metreeca/core
```

> [!WARNING]
> TypeScript consumers must use `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` (or `"node16"`/`"nodenext"`) in `tsconfig.json`. The
> legacy `"node"` resolver is not supported.
